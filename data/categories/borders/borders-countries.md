Borders countriesBorders a specified number of countries.

For example, in the category "Borders 4-5 countries" Ukraine would be an invalid answer, as it borders 7 countries. The correct answer must fall within the specified range for the category. So, Romania (borders 5 countries) or Czechia (borders 4 countries) would be valid answers. Does not include overseas departments as they are represented as separate entities in our games.
