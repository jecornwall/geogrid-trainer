Flag has a coat of armsThe flag has a coat of arms, national emblem, or national seal.

Even though the design of an emblem doesn't follow the rules of heraldry and so not containing a shield (escutcheon) in the center, we decided to include them in this category. Many unheraldic national emblems are colloquially called national coats of arms anyway, because they are used for the same purposes as national coats of arms.
