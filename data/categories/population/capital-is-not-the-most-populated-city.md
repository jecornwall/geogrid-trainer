Capital is not the most populated cityThe capital city of the country is not the largest in terms of population, with another city having a higher population.

For example, Australia's capital, Canberra, is not the most populated city, as Sydney holds that distinction.

Note on countries with multiple capitals:For Capital is not the most populated city, the category is true only if none of the official capitals are the most populated city. If any of the capitals are the most populated city, it is considered false.
